# xtn blog for programmy stuffs

blog to contain all your projects plus a journal for each one as to ur thought process going through

any other stuff u just wanna throw in there lol



okay so you need:

1. database

2. an api to connect the client to the database

3. a front-end to the butt-end. you know react so you can go with that and whip it up easy peasey (but maybe )

4. styling............................. help. HAHAHHAA

5. go back to figuring out 4 

```

specifics:

BACKEND = back4app

FRONTEND = just vite on github pages


database => mysql

api      => gorilla mux in golang | https://github.com/gorilla/mux

frontend => react (probably vite or smthing. just something that's client side rendered is all i really need)

styling => uhm

```
